# Build an app with AWS Cloud Development Kit Workshop

## Lesson 00 - CDK setup and basics

### What is AWS CDK?

According to the docs:

> "The AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK) is an open source software development framework to model and provision your cloud application resources using familiar programming languages."

In other words: AWS CDK allows us to use a programming language that we all know and love (or at least tolerate) - TypeScript - to define and provision an infrastructure of an app in AWS cloud.

AWS Lambda, S3 buckets, DynamoDB tables, API Gateways - we can define all those resources (and connections between them) with TypeScript and deploy those to the Cloud without even leaving our editor.
