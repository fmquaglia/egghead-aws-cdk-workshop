# Build an app with AWS Cloud Development Kit Workshop

## Lesson 03.5 - Executing a lambda function locally

This is a bit optional and we may end up skipping it in the actual workshop, although I think it's interesting (and useful!) to see how we can call a lambda function on our machine.

It's definitely easier and faster than re-deploying a function to _THE CLOUD_ every time we want to test something.

In order to do that, we need to have `AWS SAM` installed on our machine (the instructions are in the main [README](../README.md)). Don't worry - if you don't have it installed, you don't need to follow along. Like I said, this section is a bit optional :)

## Exercises

1. Run `cdk synth --no-staging > template.yaml` in order to create a CloudFormation template and store it in a `template.yaml` file

2. Find the logical ID for your Lambda function in template.yaml. It will look like `MyFunction12345678`, where `12345678` represents an 8-character unique ID that the AWS CDK generates for all resources. The line right after it should look like `Type: AWS::Lambda::Function`

3. Run the function by executing: `sam local invoke HelloLambda12345678`

4. We can also pass custom events to the function, to do that - take a look at `sample_events` directory, there's a sample `hello.json` event in there

5. To execute a lambda function locally with a custom event, run `sam local invoke HelloLambda3D9C82D6 -e sample_events/hello.json`

   _Why is running a lambda function locally useful?_
