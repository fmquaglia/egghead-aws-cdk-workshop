# Build an app with AWS Cloud Development Kit Workshop

## Lesson 14 - Destroying a CDK stack

We've reached the end of the workshop - congrats! ðŸŽ‰

I hope you've had fun and you've learned an awful lot, unfortunately all good things needs to come to an end :(

When experimenting with CDK it's possible to deploy a service which is outside of free tier (since nearly all AWS services are supported) and it's useful to be able to delete an entire CDK stack if necessary.

## Exercises

1. Run `cdk destroy` in order to delete our stack. (Don't worry, you can always deploy it again, that's the magic of CDK!)

2. Check out https://github.com/cdk-patterns/serverless to see what kind of services and architectures you're now able to deploy in only a couple of minutes since you already have all the necessary skills!
